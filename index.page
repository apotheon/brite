= The "Brite" Idea

Brite is a static website/blog generator. It is very easy to use,
yet versitle. It's design is both innovative and wisly borrows
best-of-breed ideas from similar projects.

= Overview

You will likely want to install Brite via RubyGems.

  $ gem install brite

If you're old fashion and want to install to a site
location, please see Setup.rb[http://rubyworks.github.com/setup].

A good way to get started is to look at the files for this website or
at the Sow template for a brite project.

* http://github.com/rubyworks/brite/tree/master/site/
* https://github.com/rubyworks/brite/tree/master/lib/plugins/sow/brite/

To make it even easier you can install Sow[http://rubyworks.github.com/sow]
and then use:

  $ sow brite <site-dir>

In either case you will see somthing along the lines of these files:

  2010/01/sample.post
  assets/images/logo.jpg
  assets/styles/custom.css
  assets/styles/reset.css
  page.layout
  post.layout
  index.page

Look them over carefully, and I think you will quickly see how the system works.
Try editing your copy of the files. Then, when you are ready, from the toplevel
of the directory, type:

  $ brite

Brite will list the files generated. Now you can fire up you browser:

  $ firefox index.html

And all things are made bright :)
