= The "Brite" Idea

Brite is a static website/blog generation tool. It is very
easy to use, borrows some best-of-breed ideas from similar
projects, yet is very innovate in it's own right.

Note that this is early release. There are still a fair number
of issues to address to bring Brite up to full-speed.

= Overview

You will likely want to install using RubyGems.

  $ gem install brite

If you're old fashion and want to install to a site
location, please use Setup.rb (http://setup.rubyforge.org).

The best way to get started is to copy the example site
located in plug/brite.sow/ directory of the Brite project.
For and easier method you can install Sow(see http://proutils.rubyforge.org)
and then use:

  $ sow brite <site-dir>

In either case you will notice these files:

  2009/09/sample.post
  assets/images/logo.jpg
  assets/styles/reset.css
  assets/styles/font.css
  assets/styles/color.css
  assets/styles/form.css
  page.layout
  post.layout
  index.page

Look them over carefully, and I think you will quickly see how the
system works. Try editing a few of the files. Then, when you are ready,
from the toplevel of the directory, type:

  $ brite

Brite will list the files generated. Now you can fire up you browser:

  $ firefox index.html

And all things are made bright :)
